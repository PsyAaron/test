Our experience of vision does not necessarily originate directly from external stimuli. Mental imagery is a good example to illustrate this. We all have the experience of mental imagery, which is usually described as “mind’s eye”. By adopting mental imagery, we can retrieve past scenes, construct current objects and plan future activities without corresponding stimuli being presented in front of your eyes. Mental imagery is regarded to be a type of visual experience that is created through top-down procedure in human brain. In the mean time, there are certain types of visual illusions that can induce visual experience without corresponding retinal input as well. A typical example of this illusion is neon colour spreading illusion shown in FigureXX. This illusion contains four groups of concentric circles and part of the circular groups was a chromatic colour and the other part is white. If the four sectors are in the same colour and their edges are in line with a contour of a square shape, you are likely to perceive colour filling into the central part of the illusory square. Sometimes even the contours are not well aligned, we could still perceive the illusory colour to some extent (see Figure XX).
